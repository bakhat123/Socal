The city's limited coastline and strict coastal development regulations have created an inherently scarce luxury asset class that international investors increasingly view as a hedge against global economic uncertainty. Recent market analysis reveals that luxury oceanfront estates in Newport Beach now command between $3,200 to $12,000 per square foot, with the most exclusive beachfront properties on the Balboa Peninsula reaching unprecedented valuations. The market has experienced a notable shift toward international buyers, particularly from Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern, and European markets, who now represent 45% of all oceanfront transactions exceeding $25 million.",
